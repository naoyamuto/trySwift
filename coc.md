# Code of Conduct

_try! Swift_ is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

We donâ€™t want anyone to be excluded due to age, gender, sexual orientation, mental or physical impairments, appearance or skin colour, national or religious background. We hope to see the same attitude with our attendees, and look forward to experiencing a non-violent and peaceful event with you.

## For Speakers

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate during talks. Refrain from using these in your slides. Sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not acceptable.

## For Attendees

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Action

If you are being harassed, notice someone else that is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please flag down a member of the _try! Swift_ staff. Alternatively, if you feel you need to do this privately, please email [info@tryswiftconf.com](mailto:info@tryswiftconf.com).
 
_try! Swift_ staff can be identified by t-shirts or will be stationed at reception/check-in of the venue.
