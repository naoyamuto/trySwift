## Convince Your Boss
It can be hard to convince your boss to let you leave work to attend a pricey conference—so, to help you out, we've compiled a list of reasons to help you convince your boss:

1. _If you're hiring, **try!Swift** is a great way to meet other talented iOS developers._ The easiest way to find awesome developers you'd love to work with is to chat with them in person!
2. _If you're still learning, **try!Swift** is full of talks that will help you learn a bunch in a short amount of time._ Going to a conference is a great way at any level to expose yourself to stuff you didn't even know existed. Even if you're an experienced Objective-C developer, this conference will be full of Swift information that will be informative and interesting.
3. _This is a great chance to talk to users._ Other developers are also other users! try!Swift is an opportunity to ask others about your product and get feedback.
